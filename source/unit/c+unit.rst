C ++ unit testing  
=============================================
C ++ is mainly for testing each class, wings will automatically generate the driver code of each class and the corresponding GoogleTest code.

Naming rules
-----------------------

The file name corresponding to the driver generated by each class is: driver + class name.cc and .h , the name of the driver class is: Driver + ClassName ( class name ) , there are many operator overloaded functions in c ++ , in order to ensure the uniqueness of the function, The functions for the class are numbered from 0 , that is, Driver + function name + number.


Generate code
-----------------------

The corresponding test class code will be generated for each class in C ++ . As shown in Figure 8 below, Rectangle is the class under test and contains 3 member variables of type Point , int , std :: string, assuming Rectangle as the function parameter, the configuration of such object requires . 3 members variable assignment, WINGS automatically inserts a constructor in the source code for each class, the member variable assignment.

For each driver class in Figure 9 , a corresponding constructor will be generated to initialize the tested class, as shown in Figure 10 :

In the driver class, a driver function is generated for each function. As shown in Figure 11 :
